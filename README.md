# Features
## Open/Append YAML Dictionaries
![image](https://github.com/Cadlaxa/OpenUtau-Dictionary-Editor/assets/92255161/a0bf596e-01a9-4ec6-bbe2-0d2503972122)
- By clicking the **`[Open YAML File]`** button, you can open a premade OpenUTAU YAML dictionary to edit them directly with this GUI toolkit. The **`[Append YAML File]`** button's function is to merge multiple YAML files so that users can merge them together.
## Create a YAML Dictionary from Scratch
![image](https://github.com/Cadlaxa/OpenUtau-Dictionary-Editor/assets/92255161/4d4b6537-2622-4c2c-b13e-a9838037ee95)
- You can add the graphemes and phonemes onto the Manual Entry section. Pressing the **`[Add Entry]`** button will add them to the Entries viewer. Using the **`[Delete Entry]`** button or the delete button on your keyboard will delete the selected entry. By clicking the entries first then `shift` + `click` to other entries will highlight them so that users can batch delete the entries using the **`[Delete Entry]`** button or the delete keyboard button.
- `Note: If creating a dictionary from scratch, choose a yaml template from the combobox picker`
## Using OpenUtau YAML Templates or Custom Template
![image](https://github.com/Cadlaxa/OpenUtau-Dictionary-Editor/assets/92255161/7079a076-8933-44e2-8428-939c52da749a)
- Using the combobox picker, users can choose their OpenUtau YAML template to create their dictionary. Also, users can add their own templates by placing them in the **`[Templates]`** folder so the GUI toolkit will recognize the files via the templates.ini and use them for dictionary creation.
- `Tip: if you're creating a custom dict from scratch, add your template from the templates folder so that you can use it on the picker and add your entries, if you have already made a custom dict, just import them to the editor then use 'Current Template' so that it add the entries to the current imported yaml file and still preserve the custom symbols`
## Sorting the Entries
